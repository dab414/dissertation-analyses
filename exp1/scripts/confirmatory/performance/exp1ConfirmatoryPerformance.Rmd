This document is dedicated to conducting the confirmatory performance analyses that were proposed for Experiment 1.

# Design and Predictions
**Design.** The design and analysis is a 2 (difficulty: harder than reference vs. easier than reference) X 2 (difference: moderate vs. extreme) X 2 (transition: repeat vs. switch) within-subjects ANOVA on RTs and error rates.  
**Predictions.** There are predicted main effects of difficulty (easier deck has faster RTs and more errors than harder), and transition (typical switch cost). There is a predicted two-way interaction between difference and difficulty, such that harder decks are associated with slower RTs. There is another predicted two-way interaction between transition and difficulty, such that switch costs are expected to be greater for decks that are easier than reference. Finally, there is a predicted three-way interaction, where switch costs are expected to be larger for easier relative to harder decks. This is because switching tends to be more costly when it is done more infrequently.



# Results

## Response Times
Below is the cleaned data:
```{r}
d <- read.csv('../../../data/dstClean.csv')
d <- d %>% 
  filter(transition != 'startBlock', chosenDeckId != 'reference') 
N <- d %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>% 
  summarize(n()) %>% 
  nrow(.)
d
```
**The sample size is `r N`.**

### Visualize the Results

```{r}
cellMeans <- d %>% 
  group_by(subject, difference, difficulty, transition) %>% 
  summarize(mrt = mean(cuedRt)) %>% 
  group_by(difference, difficulty, transition) %>% 
  summarize(rt = mean(mrt), se = sd(mrt) / sqrt(n())) 
cellMeans
cellMeans %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = difference, y = rt, group = transition)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', aes(fill = transition), color = 'black', position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt - se, ymax = rt + se), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), width = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~difficulty) + 
  theme_bw() +
  xlab('Transition Type') + 
  ylab('Response Time (ms)') + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = 'Transition', values = c(`repeat` = 'Light Grey', switch = 'Black')) +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(color = 'black', fill = 'white'),
        legend.position = 'top')
```


### Statistics
**Subject-wise cell means**
```{r}
subjectCellMeans <- d %>% 
  group_by(subject, difference, difficulty, transition) %>% 
  summarize(rt = mean(cuedRt)) 
subjectCellMeans
```

**Omnibus Model**
*There are 15 subjects with missing cells in the design and they are being dropped from the analysis*
```{r}
badSubjects <- data.table(subjectCellMeans)[,.(count = .N), by = subject][count < 8, subject]
subjectCellMeans <- subjectCellMeans[!(subjectCellMeans$subject %in% badSubjects),]
m1 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = .(difference, difficulty, transition), dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans, detailed = TRUE)
cs <- c(colnames(m1$ANOVA), 'n2p')
omni <- cbind(m1, data.frame(n2p = m1$ANOVA$SSn / (m1$ANOVA$SSn + m1$ANOVA$SSd)))
colnames(omni) <- cs
omni$p <- round(omni$p, 3)
omni
```

**Marginal Means for Main Effects**
```{r}
d %>% 
  group_by(subject, difficulty) %>% 
  summarize(rtime = mean(cuedRt)) %>% 
  group_by(difficulty) %>% 
  summarize(rt = mean(rtime), se = sd(rtime) / sqrt(N))
```

```{r}
d %>% 
  group_by(subject, transition) %>% 
  summarize(rtime = mean(cuedRt)) %>% 
  group_by(transition) %>% 
  summarize(rt = mean(rtime), se = sd(rtime) / sqrt(N))
```


**Planned Comparisons**

Difficulty X Difference 
```{r}
## difficulty X difference
DFd <- m1$ANOVA$DFd[5]
SSd <- m1$ANOVA$SSd[5]
MSe <- SSd / DFd

omnibusParams <- c('DFd' = DFd, 'SSd' = SSd, 'MSe' = MSe)

d %>% 
  group_by(subject, difference, difficulty) %>% 
  summarize(mrt = mean(cuedRt)) %>% 
  group_by(difference, difficulty) %>% 
  summarize(rt = mean(mrt), se = sd(mrt) / sqrt(n()))


m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = difference, dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Easier than Reference',], detailed = TRUE)

easier <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = difference, dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Harder than reference',], detailed = TRUE)
harder <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

data.frame(Contrast = c('Simple effect of difference for Easier than Reference', 'Simple effect of difference for Harder than Reference'),
           Result = c(easier, harder))
```

Transition X Difficulty

```{r}
DFd <- m1$ANOVA$DFd[7]
SSd <- m1$ANOVA$SSd[7]
MSe <- SSd / DFd

omnibusParams <- c('DFd' = DFd, 'SSd' = SSd, 'MSe' = MSe)

subjectCellMeans %>% 
  group_by(subject, transition, difficulty) %>% 
  summarize(mrt = mean(rt)) %>% 
  group_by(transition, difficulty) %>% 
  summarize(rt = mean(mrt), se = sd(mrt) / sqrt(n())) 

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = transition, dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Easier than Reference',], detailed = TRUE)

easier <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = transition, dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Harder than reference',], detailed = TRUE)
harder <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

data.frame(Contrast = c('Simple effect of transition for Easier than Reference', 'Simple effect of transition for Harder than Reference'),
           Result = c(easier, harder))
```


**Post-hoc follow ups on the three-way interaction**

```{r}
DFd <- m1$ANOVA$DFd[8]
SSd <- m1$ANOVA$SSd[8]
MSe <- SSd / DFd
omnibusParams <- c('DFd' = DFd, 'SSd' = SSd, 'MSe' = MSe)

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = .(transition, difference), dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Easier than Reference',], detailed = TRUE)

easier <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = .(transition, difference), dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Harder than reference',], detailed = TRUE)

harder <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

data.frame(Contrast = c('Simple effect of transition X difference for Easier than Reference', 'Simple effect of transition X difference for Harder than Reference'),
           Result = c(easier, harder))

```

Testing for simple effect of difference across levels of transition (for easier than reference only)

```{r}
SSd <- m1$ANOVA$SSd[2]
DFd <- m1$ANOVA$DFd[2]
MSe <- SSd / DFd
omnibusParams <- c('DFd' = DFd, 'SSd' = SSd, 'MSe' = MSe)

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = difference, dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Easier than Reference' & subjectCellMeans$transition == 'repeat',], detailed = TRUE)

repetition <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = difference, dv = rt, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Easier than Reference' & subjectCellMeans$transition == 'switch',], detailed = TRUE)

Switch <- formatSimpleEffects(m2, omnibusParams)

data.frame(Contrast = c('Simple effect of difference for repetitions and Easier than Reference', 'Simple effect of difference for switches and Easier than Reference'),
           Result = c(repetition, Switch))
```


## Error Rates
Below is the cleaned data:
```{r}
d <- read.csv('../../../data/dstCleanErrors.csv')
d <- d %>% 
  filter(transition != 'startBlock', chosenDeckId != 'reference')
d
```

### Visualize the Results

  group_by(subject, difference, difficulty, transition) %>% 
  summarize(merror = mean(error)) %>%

  summarize(error = mean(merror), se = sd(merror) / sqrt(n())) 
cellMeans
cellMeans %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = difference, y = error, group = transition)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', aes(fill = transition), color = 'black', position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = error - se, ymax = error + se), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), width = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~difficulty) + 
  theme_bw() +
  xlab('Transition Type') + 
  ylab('Error Rate') + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = 'Transition', values = c(`repeat` = 'Light Grey', switch = 'Black')) +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(color = 'black', fill = 'white'),
        legend.position = 'top')
```

```{r}

           Result = c(easier, harder))
```

d %>%

m2 <- ezANOVA(wid = subject, within = transition, dv = error, data = subjectCellMeans[subjectCellMeans$difficulty == 'Harder than reference',], detailed = TRUE)

data.frame(Contrast = c('Simple effect of transition for Easier than Reference', 'Simple effect of transition for Harder than Reference'),
           Result = c(easier, harder))
```


I'll deal with the three-way only if I need to.
