  preparation for day 1 of data collection:
    finish data pipeline
    make an analysis homepage
      which links to the different sub analysis pages
    don't forget to drop sandbox data from the pipeline
      done
    implement an rsync in ./downloadAndProcess instead of downloading every time
      done

    code up a quickSum.py that i can call from local
      done sort of
      used shortcuts instead, too complicated otherwise
