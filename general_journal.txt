  experiments 1 and 2 are successfully collected
    wooo, that was a rush

  ive quickly set up a bunch of analyses already, but now it's time to think carefully about everything that needs to be done

  things that still need to be done:
    exp 1
      investigate order effects
      learning rate analysis
        big caveat here is that it's just harder to detect the difference between 'switching medium amount' vs 'switching a lot' or 'switching medium' vs 'barely switching'
          the control you'd need is where people just detect frequency of switching without actually performing the switching
    exp 2
      run choice analyses with and without trimming
      flesh out the rapid fire analysis
        make a decision on whether or not to use that data
      a document for dealing with random effects
        make the case for why controlling for them is important
      other random exploratory stuff given the data i have
        correlating individual difference vars with choice

  preparation for day 1 of data collection:
    finish data pipeline
    make an analysis homepage
      which links to the different sub analysis pages
    don't forget to drop sandbox data from the pipeline
      done
    implement an rsync in ./downloadAndProcess instead of downloading every time
      done

    code up a quickSum.py that i can call from local
      done sort of
      used shortcuts instead, too complicated otherwise

  alright, it's go time

  sub journal:
    16:04
      4 total HITs active
      all assignments for all hits got scooped up p much immediately
      very few inits on the server, though
