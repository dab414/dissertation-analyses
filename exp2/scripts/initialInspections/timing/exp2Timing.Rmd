This document is dedicated to determining how many cycles of four trials (all conditions) will be needed to reach about 25 mins.  

I performed a full cycle (performed each condition once) and I'll extrapolate based on the overall finishing time of this one phase.   

(I'm assuming the cued task switching trial threshold calculated from Experiment 1 will also be appropriate for Experiment 2)

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
d <- read.csv('../../../data/dst.csv')
head(d)
```



```{r}
print(paste('Phase run time:', round(max(d$phaseRunTime)/1000, 2), 'seconds'))
```


```{r}
print(paste('Total target cycles:', round((25*60) / 90.26)))
```
