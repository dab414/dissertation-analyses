the bayesian glmer:
	MCMCglmm::MCMCglmm

is it a fixed or random effect?
	says this is more complicated than expected

overdispersion
	is the idea that the observed data has greater variance than what would be expected based on the model fit
	sum of squares of residuals should approximate a chi square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the residual df of the model
	```
	overdisp_fun <- function(model) {
		rdf <- df.residual(model) ## get the degrees of freedom residual (a scalar)
		rp <- residuals(model, type='pearson') ## vector of residuals length of the data
		Pearson.chisq <- sum(rp^2)
		prat <- Pearson.chisq / rdf
		pval <- pchisq(Pearson.chisq, df = rdf, lower.tail = FALSE)
		c(chisq = Pearson.chisq, ratio = prat, rdf = rdf, p = pval)
	}

	if overdispersion is violated
		you can fit a quasilikelihood model
			this soudns like a real pain

	(sort of restricting my notes here to things that could potentially be relevant to the dissertation)


complete separation
	it would be a problem for binomial models if there is some linear combination of the predictors that perfectly separates the responses
		doesn't seem like a concern here tho

non-gaussian random effects
	this would also be concerning, he says R isn't really equipped to handle this case

leaving off here

later on he talks about how to get error estimates around fixed effects, with or without consideration of random variance
